To enter my office in NTT, I need to scan a QR code which sends an sms. This program is to help automate the process through a single command in a telegram bot I created.

I run the script on my computer through task scheduler and then trigger the script through my telegram bot. The script then opens the link and fills up the form with python selenium.
